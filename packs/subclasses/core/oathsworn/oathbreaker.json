		"description": "<p><strong>Dark Benediction</strong>. Fallen from the light, but not entirely. You lose access to the following Radiant spells: True Strike, Heal, and Warding Bond; and gain access to the following Necrotic spells: Entice, Shadowtrap, and Dread Visage. Whenever you can choose a Utility Spell, you may choose a Radiant or Necrotic one.</p><p><strong>Paragon of Power</strong>. (Replaces Paragon of Virtue) Advantage on Might checks when attempting to intimidate others.</p><p><strong>Aura of Suffering</strong>. You gain an aura with a Reach of 4 and can Interpose for an ally anywhere within your aura; however, your Radiant Judgment ability no longer triggers when attacked. Instead, it triggers whenever you could Interpose but don't.</p><p>LEVEL 3</p><p><strong>We All Suffer</strong>. Gain +2 max Wounds. When an ally within your aura would gain any Wounds or fail a save, you may suffer the effect instead and trigger your Radiant Judgment ability.</p><p><strong>Bring Me Your Pain</strong>. Reaction (When a willing ally within your aura would drop to 0 HP): Switch HP with them (if your current HP is higher than their max HP, they gain Temp HP equal to the difference), dropping to 0 hp and gaining the Wound instead.</p><p>LEVEL 7</p><p><strong>Torment</strong>. Your Lay on Hands heals you for twice as much, and others for half as much.
