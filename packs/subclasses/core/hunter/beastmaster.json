		"description": "<p><strong>Beastmaster.</strong> Choose a Small, Medium, or Large animal as your companion. Instead of your first 2 Thrill of the Hunt (TotH) abilities, you can select Go for the Throat! and Protect Me! to use with your companion.</p><p><strong>No Stats or Actions to Track!</strong> Your companion’s HP and movement are abstracted; it knows where it is most needed without being told—whether defending you or attacking your quarry. It is smart enough, and you are caring enough, to make sure it is never put in mortal danger.</p><p><strong>Extra Abilities?</strong> At the GM’s discretion, your companion can also do anything the base animal can do: fly, sniff out scents, be used as a mount, etc. Even more complex actions like Grapple or Help may be doable if it makes sense (you’ll need to spend 1 action to command it though—it isn’t smart enough to do so on its own).</p><p>SMALL COMPANION </p><p>(Cat, Bat, Hawk, Raccoon, Rooster, Ferret, etc.)</p><p>• <strong>Keen Eyes</strong>. (1/encounter) Mark a target for free. Level 7. 2/encounter. Level 11. 3/encounter.</p><p>• <strong>Protect me!</strong> (1/encounter) Whenever you Defend, your companion distracts the attacker, causing the attack to miss, and you move up to half your speed away. Level 7. 2/encounter.</p><p>• <strong>Go for the Throat!</strong> (1/encounter) Costs 1 TotH charge: Your companion attacks your quarry for 1d4+LVL damage for free (ignoring armor). Level 11. 2/encounter, 1/round. Level 15. 3/encounter, 1/round.</p><p>MEDIUM COMPANION </p><p>(Wolf, Boar, Panther, Vulture, Giant Spider, etc.) Req. Level 3.</p><p>• <strong>Ferocious</strong>. Whenever you or your companion crit your quarry, your companion attacks again for LVL damage (ignoring armor), and you can move up to 2 spaces for free. Level 7. 4 spaces. Level 15. 6 spaces.</p><p>• <strong>Protect me!</strong> When you Defend, your companion may first attack that creature for 1d4+LVL damage.</p><p>• <strong>Go for the Throat!</strong> (1/encounter) Costs 1 TotH charge, action: Your companion attacks your quarry, for 1d8+(3×LVL) damage (ignoring armor). Level 11. 2/encounter.</p><p>LARGE COMPANION </p><p>(Lion, Owlbear, Elk, Giant Scorpion, Drake, etc.) Req. Level 3.</p><p>• <strong>Alpha Protector</strong>. Damage from the first attack against you each round is halved.</p><p>• <strong>Protect me!</strong> (1/encounter) After you gain a Wound, your companion can whisk you away to safety up to 12 spaces. Level 7. You are whisked away before gaining the Wound. Level 15. 2/encounter.</p><p>• <strong>Go for the Throat!</strong> (1/encounter) Costs 2 TotH charges, 2 actions: Your companion attacks your quarry for 1d12+(4×LVL) damage (ignoring armor). If that creature dies, you may deal half as much to another creature within Reach 4. Level 11. 2/encounter.</p><hr><p>Note. Your companion’s attacks count as your own for gaining TotH charges. Abilities that spend TotH charges cannot miss nor can they generate new charges. Unused charges are lost when combat ends.</p>",
