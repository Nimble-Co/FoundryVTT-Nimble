(1/round) Your Lifebinding Spirit can act for free while you are Dying.</p><p><strong>Life is Beautiful</strong>. Harmless and lovely creatures such as butterflies and humming birds are attracted to your presence and often follow you. Flowers bloom more vibrantly in your presence.</p><p>LEVEL 7 </p><p><strong>Conduit of Light</strong>. When an effect caused by you would heal HP, you may expend 1 use of Searing Light to heal (or damage, ignoring armor) another target within 6 spaces of yourself for the same amount.</p><p>LEVEL 11 </p><p><strong>Powerful Healer</strong>. (WIL times/Safe Rest) Whenever you would roll dice to heal damage, you may instead heal the max amount you could roll, or give that many temp HP.</p><p>LEVEL 15 </p><p><strong>Empowered Conduit</strong>.
