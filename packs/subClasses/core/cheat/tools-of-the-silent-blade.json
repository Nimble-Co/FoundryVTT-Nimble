On a failure, instead of rolling your Sneak Attack dice, they deal the maximum amount of damage (if your target saves, regain 1 use).</p><h3>Level 11</h3><p><strong>Professional Skulker.</strong> Gain a climbing speed and advantage on Stealth checks (replaces Leave No Trace).</p><h3>Level 15</h3><p><strong>KILL.</strong> When you crit an enemy with fewer max HP than you, it dies.</p>",
