Whenever you could choose a Combat Tactic or Weapon Mastery, instead choose another Commander's Order or a tier 1 (or lower) spell from any spell school. Your Commander's Orders are also empowered with magical power.</p><p><strong>Firebrand.</strong> When you roll initiative you may cast Enchant Weapon for free (can be upcast as normal by spending additional mana).</p><p><strong>Deep Knowledge (1).</strong> Choose any tier 1 (or lower) spell and any Utility Spell.</p><h3>Level 7</h3><p><strong>Deep Knowledge (2).</strong> Choose any tier 2 (or lower) spell and any Utility Spell.</p><h3>Level 11</h3><p><strong>Deep Knowledge (3).</strong> Choose any tier 3 (or lower) spell and any Utility Spell.</p><h3>Level 15</h3><p><strong>Deep Knowledge (4).</strong> Choose any tier 4 (or lower) spell and any Utility Spell.</p>",
