Whenever you do this and whenever you crit, Invoke Chaos: Roll on the Chaos Table.</p><p><em>Where's the Chaos Table?</em> It's a secret for the GM only! Suffice it to say, rolling a 1 is really bad, but rolling a 20 is AWESOMEâ€”but if you're sure you want to spoil it, you can find it on the back inside cover of the GM's Guide. Let chaos reign!</p><h3>Level 7</h3><p><strong>Tempest Mage.</strong> Learn 1 cantrip and 1 tiered spell from the Wind school.</p><p><strong>Chaos Lash.</strong> (1/encounter) Reaction (when an enemy moves adjacent to you): They are pushed back 2 spaces, and on a failed WIL save, knocked Prone as well. Invoke Chaos.</p><h3>Level 11</h3><p><strong>Thrive in Chaos.</strong> Whenever you Invoke Chaos, you may roll twice and cause both effects. (1/Safe Rest) You may choose which roll to use instead.</p><h3>Level 15</h3><p><strong>Master of Chaos.</strong> Whenever you Invoke Chaos, roll with advantage.</p>",
