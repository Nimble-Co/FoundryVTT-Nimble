		"description": "<h3>Wrath and Ruin. </h3><p>The Berserker is destruction. He knows not fatigue nor caution—both surely driven away from him in a relentless fury. Those of barbaric nature are said to eat only the dust of war and drink naught but the blood of those felled by their own hand. </p><p>Death is no stranger, for it is said that even death fears to take a Berserker before his battle Rage is satiated. Once a Berserker has begun to fight, he only grows stronger, fueled by battle-lust and an unending Rage. The deadliest among them is not the well-rested, but those who are pushed to the brink through combat. It matters not what a Berserker takes up, be it axe or sword; flesh will be hewn from bone and heads from shoulders. Many have caved under the Berserker’s primal might—sword and spell are but straw in the wake of unbridled Rage. As a Berserker, you can: </p><p><strong>•Become a raging, damage-dealing machine.</strong> Greet death as an old friend and keep on fighting! </p><p><strong>•Increase your damage to unbelievable levels.</strong> The longer a fight goes on, the more your Rage intensifies, allowing you to deal out incredible amounts of brutality. </p><p><strong>•Use your Savage Arsenal.</strong> Choose abilities to crush your foes and laugh in the face of death!</p>",
